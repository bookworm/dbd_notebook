      | All of the work on here is a WIP which makes it difficult for me to give everything a specific license.
      | That said, I'm very big on sharing my work so if you want to use it any reason just drop me a line. Whether it be for fun,
      | for profit, for learning etc I'm probably going to say yes and give you permission under either a OS license or CC license.

      | I can say this, NONE of my work will ever be licensed in a closed manner that prevents people from sharing it freely.
      | I just don't want to lock myself into a license that could limit the potential of something.
